Welcome to the libcommon documentation
======================================

Overview
--------

libcommon is a multi-platform support library with a focus on offering
simplified and secure patterns for common operations. It borrows heavily from
D. J. Bernstein's (aka `djb`_) work as well as work from Felix von Leitner
(aka `fefe`_).
